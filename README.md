### Notes:

My first iOS app
* I got stuck in a few areas but Apple Docs + Stackover allowed me to push through
* TLDR: I wanted to create a tip calculator that is simple and just tells you what to pay. I hope you like my interpretation!
* It was a fun assignment and nice way to explore the Swift documentation.
